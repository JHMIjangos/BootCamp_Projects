# Los Indeseables Project 1
Project1 - Bank Loans

In this project we looked at a bank database containing information about loans. 

We asked questions regarding: 
- which countries have the highest approval rate? 
- which ones lend the most money? 
- the median of how much money is lent per country?
- the percent default rate. 
- the amount of credits requested per month of the year.

After cleaning our data to make it optimal, we conducted our analysis and were able to find answers to our previous questions.
The answers can be seen in our [presentation](Project_1_Bank_Loans.pptm) and in our code
